   One player thinks of a word or phrase; the other tries to guess \
   what it is one letter at a time. The number of dashes shown will be \
   equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If the guessing \
   player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the dash is \
   filled in the blanks with that letter in the right places. If the \
   word does not contain the suggested letter, the computer draws one \
   element of a hangmanâ€™s body. As the game progresses, a segment of \
   the body and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in \
   the word. If the player guesses then they win. Otherwise the player \
   who chose the word wins.\n\n"
